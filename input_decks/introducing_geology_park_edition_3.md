subduction [50]: the process whereby an oceanic plate descends into the mantle along a subduction zone; volatiles released from the subducting plate give rise to a zone of volcanoes on the opposite plate (see Figure 5.8A,B).
submarine canyon [28, 104]: a channel cut through sediments of the continental shelf or slope formed by the erosive action of a turbidity current.
sulphur [4]: an element (S) which occurs as a native element, e.g. in hot spring deposits, or as metallic sulphides (e.g. pyrite) in mineral veins or sulphates in evaporite deposits.
supercontinent [93]: a large continental mass consisting of several components that formerly, or subsequently, were themselves continents.

superposition (law of ) [71]: the principle underpinning stratigraphy – that younger strata rest upon older.
surface waves [58]: set of earthquake waves that travel around the surface of the Earth’s crust and arrive at the recording station after the P- and S-waves (see Figure 6.2A).
syenite [16]: a coarse-grained intermediate igneous rock containing a high proportion of potassic feldspar (see Table 2.1)).
symmetric fold [65]: a set of folds with limbs of equal length (see Figure 7.1C).
syncline [65]: a fold where the folded beds are in the form of a trough with the younger beds in the centre (see Figure 7.1A).
system [74]: the sequence of rocks formed during a particular period of geological time.
T
tectonic: (of a process or structure) relating to or caused by major Earth forces e.g. plate tectonics.
terminal moraine [31]: a large deposit of moraine dumped at the end of a glacier as it melts (see Figure 3.7A).
terrane [101]: a piece of crust, with well- defined boundaries, that differs in tectonic history from its neighbours, and may have originated at some distance.
Tethys ocean [42, 100]: the ocean that separated Laurasia and Gondwana during upper Palaeozoic and early Mesozoic time (see Figures 5.2, 10.5).
theca (pl. thecae) [84]: cup-like chambers enclosing the individual bodies of a graptolite colony (see Figure 9.1).
thrust fault [60]: a reverse fault which is generally gently inclined (<45o) although it may become steepened by subsequent movements (see Figure 6.4).
till [33]: see boulder clay.
tillite [41]: rock consisting of consolidated till;
an indication of a previous glaciation (see
Figure 4. 4A).
topaz [7]: crystalline mineral composed of
hydrated aluminium silicate with fluorine; 132
found in granites and pegmatites. Torridonian [95]: a late Proterozoic sedimen-
tary sequence in NW Scotland consisting of
red sandstones and conglomerates. tourmaline [7]: crystalline mineral with a
complex chemical structure, basically an alumino-silicate with boron and fluorine plus varying amounts of other elements such as sodium, magnesium, iron, manganese and lithium; found in granites and pegmatites.
transform fault [49]: a fault that forms part of a plate boundary where the plates on each side move in opposite directions, parallel to the trend of the fault.
trap [105]: in the context of petroleum deposits, a structure which hosts such a deposit (see Figure 11.1).
Triassic (Period) [100]: a unit of geological time in the Mesozoic Era, 251–200 Ma ago (see Table 8.1).
trilobites [86]: an extinct marine group of
the Phylum Arthropoda that flourished
in the Palaeozoic; they were crawling or swimming animals rather like wood lice, with a central ridge and two side ‘lobes’; they possessed a head shield with complex eyes, and an armoured segmented body and tail, each segment carrying a pair of limbs used for walking, swimming, breathing or food gathering (see Figure 9.3B).
tsunami [11, 56]: water waves with long wave- lengths caused by sudden movements of the sea floor, e.g. caused by earthquakes; they travel at high speed and may cause great destruction when they reach land.
turbidite [28]: a sedimentary deposit formed by a turbidity current, characterised by poor sorting of the sediment.
turbidity current (or flow) [28, 39]: a water current generated by gravity-induced flow, carrying large quantities of sediment of varying coarseness in suspension.
U
ultrabasic (or ultramafic) [16]: (rock) composed mainly or entirely of the ferromagnesian minerals pyroxene, olivine or hornblende.

                                unconformity [71]: the structure formed where a younger set of beds cut across an eroded older set, indicating a break in the geological record (see Figure 8.1).
uniformitarianism (theory): the doctrine, first advanced by James Hutton, that the geological record was the result of a long series of events and processes similar to those of the present day, rather than a brief sudden catastrophe like the biblical flood.
unroofing [64]: the process of stripping off the rock cover above presently exposed rock outcrop; the term is used particularly in the context of unroofing joints, which are due to the release of load pressure by this process.
Upper Palaeozoic [98]: informal name for the later part of the Palaeozoic Era (see Table 8.1).
Urals (belt) [98]: orogenic belt of late Palaeo- zoic age situated along the Urals mountains between Europe and Asia, and resulting from the collision between the Siberian continent and Laurasia (see Figure 10.5).
W
wadi [29]: a watercourse in the desert, dry except during occasional ‘flash floods’. water table [112]: the level beneath which
water is present beneath the ground surface; it is an uneven surface, varying with topography and rising or falling with rainfall variation (see Figure 11.3).
weathering [21]: the process whereby rock is altered and worn away by the physical and chemical action of the weather: e.g. of rain, wind, ice etc.
whole-rock (date) [75]: a radiometric date produced by measuring an element ratio in the whole rock rather than in a mineral constituent.
woolly mammoth [103]: a giant extinct member of the elephant family which inhabited the Arctic regions during the late Cenozoic.
wrench fault [62]: a fault where the displacement is horizontal and parallel to the trend of the fault (see Figure 6.3C).
VZ
varve [33]: a seasonal layer of sediment deposited in a glacial lake; the layer consists of a coarser part deposited during the summer melting period and is followed by finer mud deposited at other times.
vascular (system) [89]: the method used by plants or animals to transfer nutrient-bearing fluids throughout the organism.
vent [13]: the mouth of a volcano; or the igneous body feeding a volcano.
vertebrates [86]: a subphylum of the Phylum Chordata; they consist of the most advanced types of animal with a backbone and central nervous system, and include the fish, amphibia, reptiles, birds and mammals.
viscous [9]: sticky, as opposed to runny, as applied to the flow of a liquid.
volcanic ash [9]: a cloud or deposit of fine solid particles ejected explosively from a volcano. volcanic breccia [9]: a deposit of coarse angular
rock fragments ejected from a volcano.
zircon [7]: crystalline mineral composed of zirconium silicate; found in granites and pegmatites; contains traces of radioactive thorium, uranium and lead, and is used for radiometric dating.
